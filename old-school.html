<h2>Bio</h2>
<p>Consultant | Founder | Creative</p>
<p>Hi, I'm Adam. I'm an engineer by background and have worked my way up the technology team for a management consultancy for the last few years. I spot complex problems in the client environment or in the market and then solve them with creative, quick-to-deploy solutions and a strategic approach. My company Vantage Digital helps businesses transform their digital presence and achieve meaningful outcomes. I love building stuff that fixes minor inconveniences in my life. I'm a big fan of music, sport, emerging technologies and travel, so lots of my personal projects focus on those areas.</p>
